# Tsunami Modeling Notebook
This notebook provides a comprehensive study of tsunami modeling, focusing on grid refinement techniques and the comparison of simulation results with actual data. It serves as an educational and research tool for understanding the dynamics of tsunamis and improving prediction models.

This notebook was produced as part of the course **LBRTI2102 - Process-based modelling in bioscience engineering of the Univertisté Catholique de Louvain**. 

In almost all of it a python package named [Clawpack](http://www.clawpack.org/) was used. For more information about, see [this paper](http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/110856976).

## Content 

The notebook begins by examining the impact of grid resolution on tsunami simulation accuracy. It details the process of how different grid sizes affect key outputs such as wave height and speed.

Following this analysis, the notebook transitions to a comprehensive validation study where simulated results are meticulously compared against real-world data from historical tsunami events.

## Usage 
To navigate this Notebook you just have to click on the play icon next to each block of code. Be careful to run the blocks in order. It is possible that the execusion environment may reinitialise itself if you remain inactive for too long, so we advise you to finish a section when you start one and not stop in the middle.

Lastly, you need to **reset the execusion environment yourself after having runned each section** to clean up the different variables and parameters set. This is done by clicking on "réinitialiser l'enivironnement d'exécution" in the "Exécution" tab (in the highest corner of yours sreen).
but don't worry it will be recalled each time
