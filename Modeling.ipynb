We will then use the 1D shallow water equations to modelize a wave beeing trapped on a continental shelf.\n","\n","We will afterward modelize 2 dimentional shallow water equations and apply those equations to modelize the wave formed by the [2010 Chile earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Chile_earthquake).\n","\n","Finally, we will confront our model with real data to see how it has performed.\n","\n","\\\n","\n","\n","To navigate this Notebook you just have to click on the play icon next to each block of code. Be careful to run the blocks in order. It is possible that the execusion environment may reinitialise itself if you remain inactive for too long, so we advise you to finish a section when you start one and not stop in the middle.\n","\n","Lastly, you need to **reset the execusion environment yourself after having runned each section** to clean up the different variables and parameters set. This is done by clicking on \"réinitialiser l'enivironnement d'exécution\" in the \"Exécution\" tab (in the highest corner of yours sreen).\n","but don't worry it will be recalled each time\n","\n",">*Note : Clawpack has been designed to run on Linux via the Linux command prompt. So we had to find several tricks to make clawpack run on an jupyter notebook environment. However it is **CAPITAL to run this notebook on an online machine such as google colaboratory**. Without this we can't guarantee that this notebook will work properly. To do so, you simply have to go on your google drive account and either drag and drop this file on your drive or ou can right click your drive icon and select import file. **Make sure that the colaboratory extention is installed on yours drive account** [**here**](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/).*\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"glex6psnhXb3"},"source":["#**1.
